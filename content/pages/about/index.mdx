Hey, I am Shubham. I am a Software Engineer focussing mainly on Data Science & Machine Learning. In past, I have worked at Dell, Applied Materials and Koo. I was the second ML Engineer at Koo, where I developed user recommendation system for millions of users. I am a sucker for new experiences and tackling new and unknown problems. 

I have experience in classical machine learning, deep learning, distributed systems and web dev. I have also dabbled in android dev, arduino and microcontroller programming. I love to tinker. These days, I'm swimming in the shallow end of solidity ocean with a goal to create a charity token on ethereum.

I am a Tarantino nerd and love weird off beat movies. Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/global_minima).
