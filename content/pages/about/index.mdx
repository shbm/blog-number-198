Hey, I am Shubham. I am a Software Engineer focussing mainly on Data Science & Machine Learning. In past, I have worked at Dell, Applied Materials. I was also the second ML Engineer at Koo, where I developed a user recommendation system for millions of users. I am a sucker for new experiences and tackling new and unknown problems. 

I have experience in classical machine learning, deep learning, web development mainly on the backend. 

I am a Tarantino nerd and love weird off beat movies. Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/global_minima).
