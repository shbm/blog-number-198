## Berlin

Berlin is a city of artists. There are no skyscrapers, not a lot swanky places, but it has art and music. [One in three](https://www.berlin.de/en/news/6092347-5559700-berlin-inhabitants-with-foreign-roots.en.html) people have foreign roots.
People with different mother tongue. Italian kids with their musical intonation in the U Bahns.
Thick English accent from an Egyptian guy. “Do you want mango chutney in it?” The answer is always "Nein, bitte". It’s the definition of melting pot.
Art is in Berlin's DNA. [Deprivation of art in its recent history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_East_Germany#Censorship_in_Art) resulted in Berlin being one of the camping grounds for artist from allover the world. [Gorlitzer park](https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/6292h1/g%C3%B6rlitzer_park/) is where you can see people with similar interest.
Turkish food here is to die for. The best part is that it's on every corner.


## Lucknow

Lucknow is comfort. The smell of smoke, summer and gutter gives it a unique scent.
There’s a familiar comfort in that smell. Similar to smelling your own farts.
It's a city of welcoming people, always stopping by to help you. It's where I drank my first beer, learnt how to drive.
It's where I understood the difference between good food and great food. One satiates your belly, the other one satisfies your soul.
